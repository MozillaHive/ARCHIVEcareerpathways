careerpathways
==============

A prototype to visualize career pathways for web enthusiasts.

The goal of this project is to visualize the career pathways for three specific careers in the field of Technology. The prototype should help someone who is a junior in high school understand a few steps that they could take to get an entry-level job in the particular career that is being explored. The three careers are: 1) Web Developer 2) Web Designer 3) Information Technology Specialist

The career pathways will incorporate Digital/Open Badges - that will identify the criteria and assessment required for someone to achieve the badge.
